# 03.08.2022 - Psychology/Defense Mechanisms

In Psychoanalysis, defence mechanisms are ways that our mind protects itself from negative feelings by distorting the reality that we perceived. Since these mechanisms operate mostly on the unconscious level, it is difficult for the conscious mind to detect when the mind is defending and what specific emotion it is defending against.

An example of defense mechanism is the classic story of ["The Fox and the Grapes."][1] In the story, the fox tried to eat the grapes from a vine but could not reach them. Rather than admitting defeat, the fox said that the grapes were probably sour and thus undesirable.

The fox encountered a negative feeling that is he could not reach the grapes, so he distorted the reality by making the grapes undesirable. This specific mechanism is called [Rationalization][2].

Some other cool defence mechanisms:

- __Projection__: This involves individuals attributing their unacceptable thoughts, feelings or motives to another person. For example, you might judge another person for their bad choice of clothing while you yourself are insecure about your taste in fashion. By projecting what you hate onto the other person (and judge them), you deceivingly assured yourself that you're superior, and that eases the negative feeling of insecurity.

- __Displacement__: Redirecting negative feelings to a powerless substitute target. For example, my boss yelled at me, I yelled at my husband, my husband yelled at the baby, the baby bit the cat.

- __Reaction Formation__: Behaving opposite to how you think or feel. For example, you might be embarrassed for liking a classmate when you were younger, and tend to be mean or aggressive to them.
